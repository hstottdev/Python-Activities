Project: Product Price Checker
Objective:

Create a program that stores the price of two products and then prints out the name of the product which is less expensive than the other one.

Instructions:

1. Create two variables where the names of the variables are their product names. 

2. Assign each product variable with a numerical value that represents the price of the product. (Example shown below)

3. Create a conditional statement that checks to see which product is more expensive than the other one and prints out the name of the product which is less expensive.
