Project: Random Number Generator
Objective:

Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, then prints out 
the number along with its data type.

Instructions:

Import the necessary module for generating random numbers.

Create a variable named random_number and assign it a random integer between 1 and 
100.

Print the random number along with its data type using the type() function.

Ensure you use both double and single quotes for string literals in your code.

Ensure that your variables are using multi-word variable naming conventions such as 
camel case, pascal case, or snake case.

Experiment with type conversions by converting the random number to a float and then 
to a complex number.

Run your program and observe the outputs.


Example Output:
Here's a sample solution:

This small project demonstrates the following concepts:

The use of the type function in Python.
The use of double and single quote stings in Python.
Multi word variable names with camel case, pascal case and snake case.
The understanding of different data types that are used in Python.
The use of various methods to convert one data type to another in Python.
The creation of random numbers using Pythons built in random module.
How Python modules are imported. 


This project provides a simple and practical way to showcase the use of variables, 
data types, type conversions and importing modules in Python. Once you have completed
this project and have created the desired output you can add this to your GitHub 
repository to showcase your Python skills.
