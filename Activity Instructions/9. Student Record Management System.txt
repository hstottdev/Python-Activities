Project: Student Record Management System
Objective:

Create a Python script that manages student records using tuples, sets, and frozen sets, and demonstrates various operations and methods.



Instructions:

1. Create tuples to store student information (name, age, grade).

2. Use tuple methods to count and index elements.

3. Create sets to store unique student IDs and courses.

4. Perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

5. Use frozen sets to create immutable sets of student data.
