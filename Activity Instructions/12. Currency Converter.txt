Project: Currency Converter
Objective:

Create a Python script that converts currency using exchange rates stored in a 
separate module, demonstrating the concept of scope and module usage.


Instructions:

1. Create a module named exchange_rates.py to store the exchange rates.

2. Define variables for exchange rates within the module.

3. Create the main script currency_converter.py that imports the exchange_rates 
module.

4. Define functions in the main script to convert currency based on the exchange 
rates from the module.

5. Demonstrate the concept of scope by accessing variables from the module and 
within the functions.
